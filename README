== Component JSON Formats ==

A component is represented as a JavaScript/JSON object in one of three possible formats:

1. External format. Uses well-known field names like 'type', 'size', 'action' etc. All coordinates are relative to the parent. Most fields may be omitted.

2. Internal format. Uses post-minification field names like 'qQ' and 'Qq'. All coordinates are absolute (i.e. relative to the top-left corner of the mocked up screen). Most fields are expected to be present, especially things like style (to make comp.style.foo references safe).

3. External palette format. Is similar to the external format, but uses post-minification names.
